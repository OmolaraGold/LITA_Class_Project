### PROJECT TITLE: Data Analysis Process

### PROJECT OVERVIEW
---
Data analysis involves inspecting,cleansing,transforming and modelling data to discover useful information,draw conclusions and support decision making. By analysising the data received we seek to gather enough insight to make reasonable decisions based on actual data which then enable us to tell compelling stories around our data.

### DATA SOURCES
---
The source of this data set used is from an open source platform provided to me as part of the course.

### DATA ANALYSIS PROCESS
---
This process involves the following;
   1.  Identifying and Questioning
   2.  Data Collection and Gathering
   3.  Data Cleaning and Preparation
   4.  Analyzing Data
   5.  Data Visualiazation and Communication

### DATA ANAYSIS TOOLS 
---
- Microsoft Excel [DOWNLOAD HERE](https://www.microsoft.com)
     1.  For Data Cleaning
     2.  For Data Analysing
     3.  For Data Visualisation
- SQL - Structured Query Language for Data Quering
- PowerBI for Data Visualisation [DOWNLOAD HERE](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=58494)
- GitHub for portfolio building  [DOWNLOAD HERE](https://desktop.github.com/download/)

 ### DATA CLEANING AND PREPARATIONS
 ---
  Data cleaning and preparations involve the following actions;
     1.  Data loading and inspection
     2.  Handling missing variables
     3.  Data cleaning and formatting

  This involves the exploration of the data to answer answer some questions such as;
    - What is the overall sales?
    - What branch of the company is selling the most?
    - Which products sells the most?
    
### DATA ANALYSIS
---
  This is where I learnt how to write and run some basic functions used during analysis such as;
    - COUNT
    - COUNTIF
    - MAX
    - MAXIF
    - SUM
    - SUMIF
    - VLOOKUP
      
  This is where I also learnt how to write some basic line of codes and queries such as;
  
  ``` SQL
  SELECT * FROM TABLE
  WHERE CONDITION = TRUE
 ```

  ``` SQL
  SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEE
  UPDATE EMPLOYEE
  SET FIRSTNAME = 'AUSTIN'
  WHERE STAFFID = 'AB212'
  ```

### DATA VISUALIZATION
This is where how showcase my analysis with images and charts.
